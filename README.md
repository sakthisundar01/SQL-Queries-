# Project Title: Data Management for CARS24 (Dummy Data)

## Overview
This project involves analyzing and improving the data management practices for CARS24, a leading e-commerce platform for pre-owned cars in India. The project encompasses the development of Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to represent and optimize their data handling processes.

## Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) are essential tools for visualizing the flow of information within a system. This project includes multiple levels of DFDs to represent the data handling processes at CARS24:

Level 0 DFD provides a high-level overview of the data flow between the main entities: the customer, the website, and the executive.
Level 1 DFD breaks down the purchasing process into detailed activities, illustrating the data stores required at each step.
Level 2 DFD offers an in-depth view of the 'Generate Orders' process, emphasizing payment validation and order fulfillment.
Updated DFDs incorporate new features such as a shopping cart, enhanced data security, and data archiving to improve the overall system efficiency and security.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) are crucial for understanding the relationships between different data entities in a system. This section includes:

Original ERD, which depicts the initial data model for CARS24.
Updated ERD, reflecting improvements in data handling and system interactions. These diagrams help in designing a more efficient and secure database system, ensuring better data management and accessibility.
Aspects of Data Management Practices

## Effective data management involves several key aspects:

Data Sharing and Exchange: Implementing strategies to eliminate silos and promote collaboration across departments.
Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view and enable holistic analysis.
Data Security and Interoperability: Ensuring that data is protected from breaches and can be seamlessly shared between different systems. This section discusses how these practices can be applied to enhance CARS24's data management framework.
Analysing the Data Management Practices
